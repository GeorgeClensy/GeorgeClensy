### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

~~I am IAmGeeCee!~~ I am Gee Cee... I program (as a hobby) with microsoft's dotnet framework, mainly C#. I also know html,css,xaml in uwp and am learning javascript. I can't decide whether i want to do web development or app development. Android is better and scone is pronounced scone.

Thank you for reading this. Byeee ðŸ‘‹
