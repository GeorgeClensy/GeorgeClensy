### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am IAmGeeCee (Its the first letters of my actuall name)! My fav language is C#. I do programming as a hobby. I prefer android and like home screen customization. (Icon packs and launchers) I have a pc with a pentium core and 8gb ram. I use visual studio. And scone is pronounced scone. Ed sheeran is my favourite artist.

PurpleFlame Studios is my project thing if you know what i mean which you probably dont. Its like a buisness but just me. And not a real businnes. Ya know. Ok whatever.

Oh yeah. OPEN SOURCE IS YES.
